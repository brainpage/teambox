    And I am logged in as @mislav
    And I am currently in the project ruby_rockstars

    When I go to the uploads page of the "Ruby Rockstars" project
    And I click upload list item for "tb-space.jpg" file
    And I follow "Move to another folder"
    And I select "Director" from target folders list
    And I follow "Move"
    Then I should not see "tb-space.jpg"
    And I should see "2 files" within ".upload"
    When I enter "Director" folder
